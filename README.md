# TutoringService
In this project, the student will provide a free tutoring service provided by other students. Each student will post the subjects they feel confident about and also the subjects they need help with. Students will earn points when they tutor for another student and they are going to be reviewed after the tutoring. Then, they can use those earned points to get help with the subjects they need the most. The app and/or website will match students with each other. There can be options for tutoring such as online, face to face, etc. Some students might earn points by creating quizzes or presentation materials. Also, grading might be another way of earning points.
